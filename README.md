# retro-table-tennis

A simple implementation of a table tennis game in Dart, using the HTML5 canvas.
I have written
[a game using the canvas](https://jdw1996.github.io/touch-the-bees) and
[a project in Dart](https://jdw1996.github.io/pub-name-generator) but I this is
my first project using the two together.

If you have any pointers you'd like to share about my code, feel free to
[open an issue](https://github.com/jdw1996/retro-table-tennis/issues/new) or
email me at [jdwinters96@gmail.com](mailto:jdwinters96@gmail.com).
